# python_playground

## Description
In this I am going to start some python projects with the goal of working on some smaller AI works.

Thanks given to **ChatGPT** and **Artificial Intelligence for Developers (in easysteps)*** book see [https://www.ineasysteps.com] or visit local library.

So more to come.
